                    <p>If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase from Zappos you can return your item(s) for a full refund within 365 days of purchase. (Returns must be unworn, in the state you received them, and in the original packaging.) Some items ship with an attached security tag. Merchandise returned without the original security tag attached or a damaged tag may not qualify for a refund.</p>
                    <p>The easiest way for you to return the merchandise is to get a pre-paid label by logging in at Zappos.com</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Go to the website and click on My Account in the upper right hand corner.</li>
                        <li>Log in to your account using your email address and password.</li>
                        <li>Click on the order number of the merchandise you wish to return.</li>
                        <li>Check the box to the left of the item(s) you wish to return and click on the Return Checked Item box.</li>
                        <li>Choose to have the label displayed for immediate printing or emailed if you are unable to print immediately. Then click 'Return Item(s)' at the bottom of the page.</li>
                        <li>The next page will feature a picture of the item and a barcode.</li>
                        <li>If you do not have the original packaging, please return by placing a copy of the return confirmation with merchandise inside of a plastic bag and place inside the shipping box.</li>
                        <li>On this page is where you can view for immediate printing. To display your label, click the orange link in the middle of the page that says "Click here to view your return label."</li>
                        <li>Now just print it and tape it to your shipping box with clear packing tape. Tada!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you would rather receive your label via email, instead of selecting the option to print the label, select the option to have a label emailed to you. If for any reason you are unable to print out a label, we would be happy to have the label mailed out to you. Simply let us know by email, live chat, or phone and we will gladly send it to you right away. Please note that if you choose to have the label send to you by USPS “snail mail”, it may take 7-10 days for it to arrive.</p>
                    <p>Make sure the merchandise is in its original packaging, (e.g., shoebox), and place it in a shipping box. Attach the label to the sealed box. Be sure to cover any old labels with the new one, or just peel them off. A black marker can also be used to cover any existing bar codes.</p>
                    <p>You may drop off your return at any authorized UPS shipping location, but please do not drop your return off at a drop box. To find the nearest authorized shipping location, please visit www.ups.com.</p>
                    <p>For the vast majority of returns, it takes about 5-10 Business Days for us to get your package at the fulfillment center, inspect your return, process it into inventory, and complete your refund. If the refund is being issued to a credit card, depending on your credit card company, it may take an additional 2-10 Business Days after your credit is applied for it to post to your account.</p>

They will need some information in order to pull up the account that the gift was purchased on. You will have to provide their phone number, first and last name, or email address. Any gift item being returned will be refunded to the original purchaser's method of payment. However, we would be happy to assist you with a gift return. When a gift return is processed, we will provide you with a return label to send the item back. Once we have received the item and processed the return, we will issue a gift certificate to your account. Please call the Zappos Customer Loyalty Team at 1-800-927-7671 for assistance.</p>

                    <p>As a Zappos.com customer you have the option of exchanging an eligible order instead of returning it for a refund. You may be able to process an exchange yourself for certain eligible orders in your Zappos.com account. If an order is eligible, you will see an option in your account to select an item to exchange, and will be provided the instructions and terms that apply to your exchange.</p>
                    <p>You also always have the option to contact us via phone, chat, or email, and we will gladly assist you with the exchange process. Our Customer Loyalty Team is available 24/7 and more than happy to help! Please note when our Customer Loyalty Team processes an exchange, the funds from the original order will be transferred to an e-Gift Card and applied to the replacement order when the exchange is processed. If the replacement order is returned, we will issue the refund back to an e-Gift Card for the full amount (minus any shipping charges from the original order). An exchange also requires the original order to be returned to Zappos within 14 days. If we do not receive the original order within 14 days, the credit card on file will be charged the full amount of that order.</p>

                    <p><b>Acetate:</b> While most items made of acetate are dry-clean only, some may be hand-washed in lukewarm water. Do not twist the fabric. Iron while the fabric is damp. Press the inside of the garment using a low-temperature setting. Use a pressing cloth when ironing the outside.</p>
                    <p><b>Acrylic knit:</b> Most acrylic knit garments can be machine-washed. Read the label, and check for the proper drying option. Some knits retain their shapes best if reshaped and dried flat.</p>
                    <p><b>Cashmere:</b> Check the care label before laundering cashmere. To hand-wash, use a mild detergent or shampoo. Gently squeeze the water through the garment, then rinse until the water runs clear. Do not wring or twist. Squeeze out excess water. To dry, lay flat on a towel, away from sunlight or heat.</p>
                    <p><b>Cotton:</b> Cotton holds up well to home laundering. Remove the garment from the dryer promptly to reduce wrinkling. Press using spray starch for the crispness of a laundered shirt.</p>
                    <p><b>Cotton blend:</b> Dry cotton-blend garments using your dryer's permanent-press or low-heat cycle, and remove immediately to reduce wrinkling. Touch up with a steam iron; starch for a professionally laundered look.</p>
                    <p><b>Linen:</b> Most linen garments need to be dry-cleaned or hand-washed. Follow the instructions on the care label. To touch up or press, use a steam iron on a linen setting for a crisp look.</p>
                    <p><b>Nylon:</b> Machine-wash nylon garments in warm water. Use a low-temperature setting when tumble-drying, and include a dryer sheet to reduce static electricity. Use a warm iron to press, if necessary.</p>
                    <p><b>Polyester:</b> Read the label. Usually polyester items can be machine-washed (cool) and dried (low). Check the label to see if air-drying is recommended. Touch up with a cool – never hot – iron, if necessary.</p>
                    <p><b>Rayon:</b> Make sure to read the care label for rayon clothing. Launder in cool water and a mild detergent. When machine-washing, use the gentle cycle and promptly remove garments after washing. When hand-washing, do not wring or twist the garment. To dry, roll the item in a towel to squeeze out excess water. Lay flat to dry. Iron when still damp and with the garment inside out to prevent the fabric from becoming shiny. Use a pressing cloth when ironing the right side of the garment. Pressing cloths can be purchased, or use something as simple as a piece of white cotton fabric.</p>
                    <p><b>Silk:</b> Dry cleaning may be required. Some silks are hand- or machine-washable. Do not dry silk in a clothes dryer. Garments usually look best when professionally dry-cleaned.</p>
                    <p><b>Spandex:</b> Use warm water when hand- or machine-washing items made with spandex. Line-dry or use a low temperature setting when machine-drying to preserve the elasticity of the garment.</p>
                    <p><b>Wool knit:</b> Typically wool knits need to be dry-cleaned, but check the label. If hand-washable, use cool water and a detergent for fine washables. Squeeze out excess water, then reshape and dry flat.</p>
                    <p><b>Wool (lined):</b> Lined garments generally look best when professionally dry-cleaned once a season. Between dry cleanings, remove surface soil with a brush or damp cloth. Refresh the item by hanging it from a padded hanger in a steamy bathroom; moisture will help garment shed wrinkles. When touching up with an iron, use steam in an up-and-down motion (rather than sliding the iron along the fabric).</p>

Please also note that in order to use the pre-paid gift card on Zappos, it will need to be registered or activated by following the instructions on the pre-paid gift card itself or on the card’s packaging. Also, some card may not be eligible for online purchases. Please refer to the company that issued the card for more details.</p>
